This project is a web-based control panel for a robotic arm built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
It allows users to adjust motor positions and sliders, save and retrieve poses from a database, and manage pose statuses. 
All data interactions are handled through PHP scripts and stored in a MySQL table.
